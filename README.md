### <a id="description">Description</a>
Experimenting with different dimensions of Convolutional Neural Network's **Filters** in order to find the most accurate solution for Traffic Signs Classification.

<br/>

### <a id="how-to-use">How to use</a>
- [x] The easiest way is to clone code on **Kaggle** <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-classification-with-cnn" target="_blank">here</a>.
- [x] Another option would be to download **Jupyter Notebook** file and use it at local machine. But in this case, you need to download also dataset that is located on **Kaggle** <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed" target="_blank">here</a>.
